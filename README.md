# Project with C++ 11

## Description
This project contains some examples of implementation of modern C++ 11. I am just trying to learn and understand the new features of C++ 11. 
I am using the book "C++ Primer Plus" by Stanley B. Lippman, Jos√©e Lajoie, Barbara E. Moo as a reference.
I am trying the best to understand the new features of C++ 11 and implement them in this project. 
In every project, I have done C++, Docker build, CMake, and testing.

Please bear with me if I make any mistakes or bad practices.

If you are also learning C++ 11, you can use this project as a reference. 
And you can follow path I have done and hope it can help you on doing some C++ projects.
